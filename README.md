# Introduction

Create a web application, “Bacchus”, in which you can see the current auctions and make a bid.


# Task description and requirements

“Bacchus” should show all running auctions on the first open page. In addition, a user could place bids on a chosen auction. For the bid, a user has to enter their full name and a bid amount in euros. In this task, a unique bidding user ID would be the full name + date + time. A user could indeed place a bid, however they couldn’t see other user’s bids nor the high bid at the moment, so the bid offer happens unaware of other placed bids on other user’s pages. A user should see a product name, short description, and time left ( additional information about the last parameter is in the next paragraph ).

At this very moment, auction products could be queried from a web address [http://uptime-auction-api.asurewebsites.net/api/Auction] (REST API). Each product has a `biddingEndDate` which means how long this product is in an active state, in other words, how long users could place bids. After a product’s `biddingEndDate` has expired the API product is no longer offered and instead of the previous product, a new product appears. Users’ bids should be bound with a product ID that API provides by “productId” name.

In addition, the application should present dynamic menus that work like a filter to show/hide products by category. Each menu item is a category ( API name: `productCategory` ) and shows/hides products under this category. The menu should not contain categories that don’t have any products.If a category menu item is chosen the products beyond the category are hidden. On the menu filter, there should be a “reset” option which clears the chosen category and shows all active product offers.

After an auction is finished, the winner’s name should not be shown, but their results with bidding histories should be saved


# Additional information

After an auction is finished, the winner’s name should not be shown, but their saved results with bidding histories should be accessible.


# Requirements

Visual Studio 2017 to see and debug the code
MS Server 2017 Express LocalDB to hold a database named Bacchus


# Short explanation

The database will be created automatically only once after the first launch of the application, causing a short delay before showing the first web page.
